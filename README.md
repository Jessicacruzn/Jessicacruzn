I'm a second-year Master of Public Informatics student at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. I have a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin where I specialized in data science and signal processing. I did many projects as an undergraduate that applied data science and engineering to community needs, and now I'm passionate about using data science tools to inform policy and business solutions.
